# ```{margin} Sennacherib's Campaign in the Levant
# There are three main sources for the Sennacherib's third military campaign: [Taylor Prism](https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/search_results.php?SearchMode=Text&ObjectID=P421809) in the British Museum. The [Chicago Prism](https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/search_results.php?SearchMode=Text&ObjectID=P313081) in the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago, and the [Jerusalem Prism](https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/search_results.php?SearchMode=Text&ObjectID=P430082) in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem

# On the year 701 BCE the Assyrian King Sennacherib led his troops against rebellious kingdoms in the Levant. This was his third military campaign. In his annals, written in Akkadian on clay prisms, the narration begins as follows:

# He goes all the way south until the gates of Jerusalem punishing those who rebelled and showing mercy to those who were loyal. With all his military power Sennacherib conquers one judean city after another including the fortification of Lachish and siege Jerusalem. Hezekiah, king of Juda, was among the rebellious kings.

(iii 35) To the former tribute, their annual giving, I added the payment (of) gifts (in recognition) of my overlordship and imposed (it) upon them (text: “him”).|

# However for some reasons Sennacherib spared the life of Hiskia and did not take the city in exchange of tributes as is narrated in the prism as well as in the Old Testament.

# 14 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.

# This is one of the most famous assyrian prisms and Akkadian texts.
# 
# ## What is Akkadian? 👅
# But what is Akkadian? This prism is written in Akkadian, more especifically in the Standard Babylonian dialect of Akkadian, the official language of the Assyrian kings. This language was in antiquity the *lingua franca* in the Ancient Near East. It was written with the so-called [cuneiform](cuneif) writing on wet clay, stones, metall, etc. Its decipherment was an accomplishment of many generations of scholars and its understanding brought light into the culture, science, literature, magic and history of the Ancient Near East and therefore of the Old Testament as well.  
# 
# ## What is this online course? 🧑‍💻
# This website hosts an online course book, *Introduction to Akkadian*, which offers a short introduction to the Akkadian language. By the end of this course the reading the prism presented above will be so easy like reading a tabloid.
# 
# ## Why a [Jupiter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html)? 🚀
# Jupyter Notebooks offer a very powerful platform for dynamic content. So this book aim not just to be a regular textbook but rather an interactive *vade mecum* for the languages and cultures of the ancient Near East.
