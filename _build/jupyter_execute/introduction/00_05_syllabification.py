# # L0.5: Syllabification
# In order to transliterate correctly from cuneiform it is important to determine the syllables that make up a Akkadian word. There are three rules:
# 
# - A syllable can only have one vowel.
# - A syllable may not begin or end with two consonants.
# 
#   | Akkadian word    | Syllabification      | Translation   |
#   | --------         | :--------:           | :----------:  |
#   | *balāṭum*        | *ba/la/ṭum* | to live       |
#   | *narkabtum*      | *nar/kab/tum* | chariot       |
# 
# - A syllable may not begin with a vowel:
#   - Exception 1: At the beginning of a word 👉*elûm*.
#   - Exception 2: Two succesive vowels 👉*kīam*.
#     | Akkadian word    | Syllabification      | Translation   |
#     | --------         | :--------:           | :----------:  |
#     | *elûm*           | *e/lum*              | upper         |
#     | *kīam*, *kiʾam* or *kâm* | *ki/am*, *ki/ʾam*, *kam*  | so, thus      |
#     ```{note}
#     For *kīam* there is also the writing *kâm*. 
#     ```
