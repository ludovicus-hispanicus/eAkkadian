    "# L4.1 Weak Verbs \n",
    "A weak verb is a verb whose root consists of only two consonants and one vowel, a biconsonantical base.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They can have a long vowel between the two consonants, so called **hollow roots** or **Verbs II-weak**, or after the second radical, so called **final weak verbs** or **Verbs III-weak**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```{admonition} Example\n",
    "  - **Verbs II weak**: *dâkum* \"to kill\", *dârum* \"to turn around\"\n",
    "  - **Verbs III weak**: **banûm* \"to build\", *qabû* \"to say\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the vowel is short the biconsonantical base is expanded by gemination of the second radical by making a triconsonantical by adding a root augment suchas *w(a)* or *n(a)*\n"
